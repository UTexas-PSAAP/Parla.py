This directory contains a collection of example programs written in Parla.
They are designed to be simple and easy-to-understand rather than to maximize performance.
Each example has a description at the top of the file.

The `inner.py` example is a good place to start.

These examples are **not** benchmarks. See the `benchmarks` directory for benchmark versions of these programs.
