# Languages

This directory contains documentation for the languages for our PSAAP proposal: [Parla](Parla.md) (surface language) and [Gergo](Gergo.md) (core language).
The goal of Parla is to provide a simple but usable set of high-performance programming features and allow automatic optimizations while still allowing programming control in all cases.
Parla should be usable by real world programmers.
The goal of Gergo is to provide a *minimal* but expressive set of primitives to describe and optimize Parla programs.
Gergo will not be usable by programmers, but will be simpler and more uniform to make optimization easier.
