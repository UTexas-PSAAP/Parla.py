The documentation can be built with `make` (in this directory) if the `sphinx` package installed in the Parla conda environment.
A relatively up-to-date built version of the documentation is maintained at: [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amp/psaap/Parla.py/index.html](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amp/psaap/Parla.py/index.html).
Check the upper left of this version to see which git commit it was generated from.

The `source` subdirectory contains the Sphinx markup for the Parla documentation.
The `build`subdirectory (not included in the repo) contains the output of sphinx if the documentation is built locally.
