These libraries are used by the Parla runtime to control and isolate runtimes.

The interfaces are accessed from Python using ctypes. The functions call this way
are defined in supervisor_wrappers.h and virt_dlopen.h.

The build system makes two libraries: libparla_supervisor.so and libparla_context.so.
libparla_context.so is automatically preloaded by context_new(). libparla_supervisor.so
should be preloaded into the supervisor.
